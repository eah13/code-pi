## Day 1 Schedule

### Morning Session Objectives
* Generate excitement about the Pi and Computers
* Help students feel in control of the computer even if they don't understand it yet.
* De-mystify code by making a small but very visual change to some source.

### Introductions
Let's get to know our students
* Why are you here?  (Also, here's why you should be excited)
* What have you heard about the Raspberry Pi? (Here's some of what it can do)
* What do you want to learn? (Here's what you'll leave the camp with)

Let's talk about why we're interested in teaching the Raspberry Pi
* A little bit of bio
* What we would've done with Raspberry Pi if we'd had it
* Work and Play: how Raspberry Pi fits into the future

### Orientation
Turn on the Pi and show what it can do:
* High resolution displays.
* Audio
* Internet
* Electronics

Here it's up to you but I'd suggest having everything setup ahead of time so that you can work everyone through playing video, sounds, and maybe even basic blinkies on a breadboard.  This segment is designed to connect the 'why you should be excited' part above with the device that each student has, and help them feel like they have the ability to make these things happen.

### Peeking under the Hood

In this section we open up a Pygame game and modify some of its source code.

TODO: pick a good game for this (Connect Four?)

TODO: get or make pngs of the students' faces?

From a terminal or IDLE, open the source code and read through some of it.

Hack the game to change the images to the students' faces, then play a little.  Take a break.


### Lunch Break
During this time, watch a video about a cool topic such as a TED talk.


### Afternoon Session Objectives
* De-mystify the Web by changing it 
* Give the students a connection to the outside workd through our class blog
* Introduce the concept of open source

### Hacking the Web
In this section we'll see, visually, how the Web works by changing web pages to be the way we want them to be.

Pull up Google.  Open up Chrome Developer Tools.  Change some colors.

Using found image of studetns' favorite super hero, sports star, actor, etc, replace the Google logo.

Go to a news site.  View source.  Who can find the text?

### Class Blog
Note: This may require parents' permission.

Who uses Facebook?  Twitter? Who has a blog? Why?

Blogs and tech projects: a great way to show off what you're up to.  More open than Facebook, more detailed than Twitter.  Some examples.

We'll use our blog to tell the world what we're up to!

### Project ideas & Weekly Schedule
Introduce some of the cool projects students can do:
* Proximity sensor alarm
* Spooky door
* Twitter printer (print any tweet with a hashtag)
* Hue light controllers

Go over the rest of the week's schedule

We have some supplies you can use, but you'll have to leave them here.  If you have an idea of a project you'd like to have and keep, ask your parents to buy the components from adafruit and you can keep them.

Some things you might want to bring from home:
* Computers, printers, or electronics to disassemble
* Digital cameras
* Electronics parts and pieces
* Project walkthroughs found on the internet
