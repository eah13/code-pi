## Day 2 Schedule

### Day 2 Morning Objectives
* Write Python from scratch this time.
* Make a windowed program

### Review from Yesterday
* View source on a game
* View source on a web page
* Write a blog post
* Who brought in a computer to take apart? - Disassemble time
* Who found a cool project? - show and tell

### Basic programming in Python

Starting setup: R, G blinking lights.

*Handout:* Blinky program how-to 

Write a program that takes input in the form RGRGRGRG... and blinks the appropriate light.

Approach to new technologies: not understanding everything.

### Making a windowed program in Python

Starting point: educational manual and pygame, but with a focus on project interfaces.

Make a simple windowed interface that blinks R or blinks G when buttons are pressed.

### Project ideas brainstorm

Whatever you can think of.  Goal is excitement


### Lunch Break

TED talk or Raspberry Pi video.


### Computer teardown
Tearing down a normal computer to relate that to the Pi.  Learning what things do.  If possible, switch a hard drive on the computers like you would a Raspberrry Pi to show its function.

What's special about the Pi: the GPIO pins.  

### Sample Project Demos
Demo several of the components

Interweave this with project brainstorming

### Select projects, Groups, and start blogging
Vet projects for difficulty.

Groups can be two people working to both do the same project on their own Pis.

Blog posts will announce the chosen project, maybe with pictures.

### Tomorrow
* A little history of the computer (and gaming)
* Mostly Project work
* Optional Python exercises
